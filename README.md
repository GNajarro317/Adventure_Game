### Project Title
Text-Based Space Adventure Game

### Description
In this project, I developed a simplified text-based adventure game. I analyzed a demo video to understand its mechanics, documenting player choices and their outcomes. The game presents scenarios, allows for user input (1 or 2), and features randomness for varied gameplay. I implemented win/lose conditions and included a replay option to enhance user engagement.

### Key Features
* Descriptive messages for player scenarios
* Pauses between messages for readability
* Player input validation for choices
* Functions to reduce code repetition
* Random elements influencing gameplay
* Win/lose conditions based on player choices
* Prompt for replaying the game

### Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1)
Libraries used in the program:
time
random
